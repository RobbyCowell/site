## The Site
You're visiting my work-in-progress personal site, dubbed the <a href="https://github.com/RobbyCowell/site">'site'</a>.

The 'site' is an evolving engineering project, inspired by physical construction sites.

I'll be documenting the construction of the project in articles as it's built. This will be a living project, documenting itself as it's built.

With each commit and log, this repository will evolve from the bare-bones state it's in today, to a finished, fully featured website. 

This first article outlines the requirements and general plan for the project which can be found <a href="https://github.com/RobbyCowell/site/blob/main/src/articles/001-the-brief/001-the-brief.md">here</a>.
