The repository for my personal site, referred to as the 'site', as it's an evolving engineering project resembling that of of a physical construction site.

I'll be writing development logs detailing and explaining the process as the project is built over time. This will be a living project, effectively documenting itself as it's built.

With each commit and log, this repository will evolve from the bare-bones state it's in today, to a finished, fully featured website. This first log outlines the requirements and general plan for the project which can be found [here](./src/dispatches/001-the-brief.md).
