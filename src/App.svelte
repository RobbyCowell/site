<h1>Robby Cowell - üèó The Site üöß</h1>

<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Hello! I'm Robby, a software engineer, web developer, and social entrepreneur.</p>
<p>I lead a team of engineers building tools to improve cancer care.</p>
<p>I'm a co-founder of <a href="https://easyec.org/">Easy EC</a> - a tool to help young people access emergency contraception.</p>
<p>I worked as a web developer at <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google.</a></p>
<p>You can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/RobbyCowell">Twitter</a>, connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robbycowell/">LinkedIn</a>, check out my code on <a href="https://github.com/RobbyCowell/">GitHub</a> or hang out with me on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/robbycowell">Twitch</a>.</p>

<h2>The Site</h2>
<p>You're visiting my work-in-progress personal site, dubbed the <a href="https://github.com/RobbyCowell/site">'site'</a></p>
<p>The 'site' is an evolving engineering project, inspired by physical construction sites.</p>
<p>I'll be documenting the construction of the project in articles as it's built. This will be a living project, documenting itself as it's built.</p>
<p>With each commit and log, this repository will evolve from the bare-bones state it's in today, to a finished, fully featured website. This first article outlines the requirements and general plan for the project which can be found <a href="https://github.com/RobbyCowell/site/blob/main/src/articles/001-the-brief/001-the-brief.md">here.</a></p>
